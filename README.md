Dates for energy consumption

One of the issues I have faced using dates for energy data, is the amount of dates required. Instead of using a date picker, this will provide dates, validation and comparison between dates and make it easier for me to choose dates.

It should also help in preparing data in the backend/background reducing the load time.

It will also group data in intervals, hours, days, weeks, months, years for a given time and interval.
